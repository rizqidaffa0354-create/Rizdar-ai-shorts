# AI Shorts Starter

Minimal Next.js starter with the AIShortsEditor component (UI prototype).

## Quick start

1. Install deps:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000

This is a UI prototype only. API endpoints for script/voice/video generation are placeholders and must be implemented separately.
